                                           For Connecticut Water Customers
                                 Understanding the Additional Charges or Credits on Your Water Bill

                In addition to your Basic Service charge and Water Usage for your account, your bill may include surcharge or credit line items explained below. These charges have been authorized
             under state law to allow for recovery of certain approved costs between rate cases. The charges must be approved by PURA before being added to the bill. They are applied as a
             percentage of the amount billed for the Basic Service charge, Water Usage, and miscellaneous service charges as noted below. They do not apply to interest or Linebacker fees.

         WATER INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONSERVATION ADJUSTMENT (WICA) - Provides for recovery of costs for eligible infrastructure replacement projects completed and in service
            between rate cases. Examples of WICA eligible projects are the replacement of mains, valves and hydrants that are aged or deteriorated over time. The company can apply to adjust
          WICA every 6 months.

         WATER REVENUE ADJUSTMENT (WRA) - Allows water utilities to recover the difference between actual revenues collected in the year as compared to revenues approved by PURA
                 in the last rate case. The amount is reviewed and adjusted annually, based on actual revenues in the prior year. WRA is applied to miscellaneous service charges and service fees.

                                                                                                                                 ctw-147416
